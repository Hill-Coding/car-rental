# car-rental

- [ ] Create i/o package and move Scanner from CarRentalControl.java to separate class. In this class create method (ex. `public int getInt()`) which reads int and next line.
- [ ] In CarRentalControl.java create three methods (or one if it's possible) for reading int from keyboard (using 'getInt()' method from i/o package). These methods need to return proper enum valuer (ex. MainOptions, CarMenuOptions) and catch exceptions (NoSuchOptionException and InputMismatchException).

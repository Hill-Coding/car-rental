2. Compile and run project with Java

## Roadmap
- [ ] Implement core functionalities in plain Java
- [ ] Write unit tests
- [ ] Add database

## TODO
- [ ] Create i/o package and move Scanner from CarRentalControl.java to separate class. In this class create method (ex. `public int getInt()`) which reads int and next line.
- [ ] In CarRentalControl.java create three methods (or one if it's possible) for reading int from keyboard (using 'getInt()' method from i/o package). These methods need to return proper enum valuer (ex. MainOptions, CarMenuOptions) and catch exceptions (NoSuchOptionException and InputMismatchException).
